## CS50x Introduction to Computer Science

### Final Project - Week 10 Documentation

Created by: Joseph Bettenhausen. DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany

[Week 10 Specification](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/project/)

#### Description:

This is a Flask application for the final project of CS50. The title of the project is called `Groundhog`. This app allows users to record any sighting of a groundhog they have seen.

I chose to use [Poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) for environment and dependency management. I have used this before and found it ease to use. It is also becoming very popular and wanted to have more exposure to it.

I had experience with creating Django apps, but since Week 9 included a [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) application, I wanted to continue to learn more about it.

However, I opted not to use the CS50 library for SQL and instead chose to use [Flask SQL Alchemy](https://pypi.org/project/flask-sqlalchemy/). It is an extension for Flask which makes it easier to use SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is an Object Releational Mapper (ORM), which are often used in larger projects, simplify querying, and abstract away the specific database system. SQLAlchemy has gotten a lot of good reviews for usage with Python, so I wanted to implement that into this project. As I have had no experience with any ORM before, I thought it important to pick one for ease of use, setup, and with good documentation and examples.

It is said code is often read more often than written. then formatting is important, therefore I picked the popular package [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).

The Flask tutorial in the documentation uses [Pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/). Pytest is a very popular framework for testing Python projects not just Flask applications. So I was really interested in using it to write my tests and get more experience in it.

## Project Structure:

The project structure is shown below. Flask is very flexible and doesn't standardize the layout. I have chosen to use the application factory pattern.

### groundhog - Project root

The following directory and files exist in the project root directory.

- .venv
- .env
- .env.template
- .gitignore
- config.py
- LICENSE
- poetry.lock
- pyproject.toml
- README.md
- requirements.txt

#### Environment and dependency management:

The `.venv` directory is not tracked nor uploaded to public repositories. However, I listed it here as an example. This is where Poetry stores my environment for development. Using a separate environment for each project allows me to keep my global workspace clean, use different versions of libraries for each project, and supply a valid `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock` files for others to use.

The `.env` file contains secrets like passwords and API keys and should not be uploaded to public repositories! I have included a sample as `.env.template` as a way for people to get started quickly. They just need to add their specific information and remove `.template` from the file name. You can select your configuration via the environment by setting the config class in `CONFIG_TYPE` in .env and the class from `config.py`. The `config.py` shouldn't contain secrets either, so we can upload it to public repositories. This file allows you to have default configurations and build upon that via classes.

The `.gitignore` is needed for projects tracked with Git. This file allows you to not upload temporary files, secrets, or caches that are in the project folder to the public repository.

The `config.py` file contains classes for creating configurations for different environments. This allows for configurations for different environments to be stored in a single file. It also gives the ability to inherit from the default class configuration. I chose this method, because it avoids having repetition in the multiple configurations.

The `LICENSE` file is created from the GitHub template for MIT licenses and specifies the usage of this project.

The `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files are created by Poetry. The `pyproject.toml` is a configuration file from Poetry, which contains the build information defined in PEP 518. That file contains the dependencies for the project. The `poetry.lock` file is created by Poetry and this 'pins' the versions defined in the `pyproject.toml` file. This should also be uploaded to public repositories so others can install the same version of dependencies as I used.

This `README.md` file is the current file. These are a common way to give information on the project, ex. installtion or usage documentation.

The `requirements.txt` file are often still needed for builds such as GitHub Actions CI/CD or SAAS, such as Heroku or Render. Therefore Poetry allows for creating a `requirements.txt` file from the `poetry.lock`.

To create this file, you can the run command:

```
poetry export --with dev --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

### .github - GitHub Actions Workflows

In the directory .github\workflows contains YAML files for running GitHub actions. The current status includes a build of the project and executing the tests. The `codecov.yml` file is used for configuring non-defaults for the Codecov project. The `dev_build.yml` runs the CI on any commit to any branch other than the trunk branch. The `prod_pipeline.yml` runs the CI on any commit to the trunk branch. This workflow also creates and uploads a test report to Codecov. This allows for the usage of the Codecov badge at the top of this README.md. In the future this workflow would also include a CD component and deploy the app to a SAAS.

.github\workflows

- codecov.yml
- dev_build.yml
- prod_pipeline.yml

### groundhog - Module

### tests - Pytest Tests

A command to run all the tests, create a report as well as show the lines which are not yet covered is:

```
pytest --setup-show --cov=groundhog --cov-report term-missing
```

- conftest.py
- test.db

**functional**

- \_\_init\_\_.py
- test_auth.py
- test_routes.py

**unit**

- \_\_init\_\_.py
- test_chances.py
- test_config.py
- test_helpers.py
- test_models.py
- test_templates.py

The `conftest.py` file contains setup and teardown code for the tests. This is used by Pytest. The `test.db` isn't included in the repository as it is created only for some functional tests.

I grouped the tests into two directories either `functional` or `unit` which was based and level of the test. The unit tests individual functions. The functional tests test what the user is interacting with.
