## CS50x Introduction to Computer Science

### Final Project - Week 10 Documentation

Created by: Joseph Bettenhausen. DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany

#### Description:

This is a Flask application for the final project of CS50. The title of the project is called `Groundhog`. This app allows users to record sightings of groundhogs within the continental United States.

I chose to use [Poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) for environment and dependency management. I have experience with Poetry and found it easy to use. It is also becoming very popular among Python developers and I wanted to have more exposure to it.

Even though I have experience creating Django applications, I chose to make a [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) application. This would allow me to use my Python knowledge and expand my exposure to Flask, which was introduced in Week 9 of the CS50X course.

I opted not to use the CS50 library for SQL and instead chose to use [Flask SQL Alchemy](https://pypi.org/project/flask-sqlalchemy/). It is an extension for Flask which makes it easier to use SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which are often used in larger projects to simplify querying and abstract away the specific database systems. As I have had no experience with any ORM before, I thought it important to pick one for ease of use, setup, with good documentation, and examples. I wanted to implement SQLAlchemy into the project, because it has received a lot of good reviews for usage with Python.

It is said, that code is more often read than it is written. Therefore formatting and linting are important. That is why I picked the popular packages [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) to format and lint my code. Both were easy to setup and immediately useful in improving the code quality. I was also able to set them up on pre-commit check, so that they are always checking the code on every commit.

The tutorial from the official Flask documentation uses [Pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/). Pytest is a reliable and detailed framework for testing Python projects not just Flask applications. I was really interested in using it to write my tests and to further my experience with it.

## Project Structure:

The project structure is shown below. Flask is very flexible and doesn't standardize the layout. I have chosen to use the [application factory pattern](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/appfactories/).

```

### groundhog - Project root

The following directory and files exist in the project root directory.

- .venv
- .env
- .env.template
- .gitignore
- config.py
- LICENSE
- poetry.lock
- pyproject.toml
- README.md
- requirements.txt

#### Environment and dependency management:

The `.venv` directory is not tracked nor uploaded to public repositories. However, I listed it here as an example. This is where Poetry stores my environment for development. Using a separate environment for each project allows me to keep my global workspace clean, use different versions of libraries for each project, and supply a valid `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock` files for others to use.

The `.env` file contains secrets like passwords and API keys and should not be uploaded to public repositories! I have included a sample as `.env.template` as a way for people to get started quickly. They just need to add their specific information and remove `.template` from the file name. You can select your configuration via the environment by setting the config class in `CONFIG_TYPE` in .env and the class from `config.py`. The `config.py` shouldn't contain secrets either, so we can upload it to public repositories. This file allows you to have default configurations and build upon that via classes.

The `.gitignore` is needed for projects tracked with Git. This file allows you to not upload temporary files, secrets, or caches that are in the project folder to the public repository.

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The `config.py` file contains classes for creating configurations for different environments. This allows for configurations of different environments to be stored in a single file. It also gives the ability to inherit from the default class configuration. I chose this method, because it avoids having repetition in the multiple configurations.

The `LICENSE` file is created from the GitHub template for MIT licenses and specifies the usage of this project.

The `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files are created by Poetry. The `pyproject.toml` is a configuration file from Poetry, which contains the build information defined in PEP 518. That file contains the dependencies for the project. The `poetry.lock` file is created by Poetry and this 'pins' the versions defined in the `pyproject.toml` file. This should also be uploaded to public repositories so others can install the same version of dependencies that I used.

This `README.md` file is the current file. These are a common way to give information on the project, ex. installation or usage documentation.

The `requirements.txt` file are often still needed for builds such as GitHub Actions Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) or Platform As A Service (PaaS), such as Heroku or Render. Therefore Poetry allows for creating a `requirements.txt` file from the `poetry.lock`. To create this file, you can run this command:

```
poetry export --with dev --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

### .github - GitHub Actions Workflows

The directory .github\workflows contains YAML files for running GitHub actions. The current configruation builds the project and executes the unit tests. The `codecov.yml` file is used for configuring non-defaults for the coverage report for the project. The `dev_build.yml` runs the CI on any commit to any branch -- other than the trunk branch. The `prod_pipeline.yml` runs the CI on any commit to the trunk branch. This workflow also creates and uploads a test report to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/). This allows for the usage of the Codecov badge at the top of this README.md. In the future this workflow would also include a CD component and deploy the app to a PAAS.

### groundhog - Module

### tests - Pytest Tests

The command to run all the tests, create a report as well as show the lines which are not yet covered is:

```
pytest --setup-show --cov=groundhog --cov-report term-missing
```

- conftest.py
- test.db

**functional**

- \_\_init\_\_.py
- test_auth.py
- test_routes.py

**unit**

- \_\_init\_\_.py
- test_chances.py
- test_config.py
- test_helpers.py
- test_models.py
- test_templates.py

The `conftest.py` file is used by Pytest and contains the setup and teardown code for the tests. The `test.db` isn't included in the repository as it is created only for some functional tests.

I grouped the tests into two directories either `functional` or `unit` which was based on the level of the test. The unit tests test individual functions. The functional tests test the user interactions.

## Project Usage

The project focuses on tracking your groundhog sightings.

Since the project uses Flask-Migrate, the following command can be used to update your db to the latest version:

```
flask db upgrade
```

The project comes with 2 Zoos that stated they had groundhogs. To insert them into the database use the CLI command:

```
flask create-zoos
```

To the run the application from the root project directory execute the command:

```
flask run
```
